# Vibed Persona Archetypes (Inclusive Pop Culture References)

Each persona that Bolokono surfaces can borrow the vibe of a pop-culture figure who embodies the mindset without reinforcing a single demographic. These references keep the experience playful while remaining inclusive and respectful.

For each insight card we can include a short “Archetype line” (e.g., “Your craft feels like Shuri’s lab—precise, thoughtful, disciplined.”) plus a small icon or color that reinforces the reference without requiring licensed imagery. Let me know if you want me to add suggested copy for each persona card as well.
