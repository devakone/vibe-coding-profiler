# What we do
purpose: We help developers understand their coding style in the AI era by analyzing commit patterns, detecting AI-assisted workflows, and generating shareable "Vibe Coding Profiles" that reveal how developers collaborate with AI tools.

# Key concepts
- VCP (Vibe Coding Profile): A persona-based profile showing your coding patterns
- Vibe Axes: Six dimensions measuring coding style (shipping rhythm, context window, AI reliance, scope approach, feedback loop, collaboration style)
- Personas: Archetypes like "Prompt Sprinter", "Guardrailed Viber", "Methodical Architect" that represent different AI-era coding styles
